Accessibility scoring via Gemini.

_PROMPT = """You are a WCAG 2.1 accessibility auditor.

Score the following HTML page out of 100 points across these five axes (20 pts each):

1. Images & Media   — do all images have meaningful alt text? Are videos captioned?
2. Semantic Structure — are proper heading levels, landmarks, and list elements used?
3. Readability       — is the font size, line height, and contrast readable?
4. Interactive Elements — do buttons/links/forms have labels, focus states, ARIA?
5. Content Clarity   — is language plain, jargon-free, and logically ordered?

For each axis give an integer score 0-20.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format — no markdown, no explanation:
{
  "total": <0-100>,
  "images":       {"score": <0-20>, "note": "<one sentence>"},
  "structure":    {"score": <0-20>, "note": "<one sentence>"},
  "readability":  {"score": <0-20>, "note": "<one sentence>"},
  "interactive":  {"score": <0-20>, "note": "<one sentence>"},
  "clarity":      {"score": <0-20>, "note": "<one sentence>"}
